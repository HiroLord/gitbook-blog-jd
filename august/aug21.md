## Part 2

Similarly to a cover letter, the email our team is writing exists specifically to convince our "employer" that we should be chosen for this particular job. The advice I find most relevant is

> answer the employer's questions about your interest and potential contributions persuasively.

We are trying to persuade the employer to select our group over any other group for our chosen project. If we do not provide a convincing argument, we will be bumped down to our second (or third) choice. We must show the employer that we are interested in the project as well as posses the necessary skills to complete it. Detailing our independent skillsets as well as our past experiences may help us write an email with enough persuasion that would get our group chosen over others.
